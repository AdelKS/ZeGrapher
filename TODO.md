Merge work
- Make GraphDraw and mainGraph use the new settings:
    - calculate ticks from the axisSettings with graphview (or maybe come up with a diffrent approach)
    - update graphview to handle new approach and definitions
    - display tick coordinates properly following the settings (decimal global multiplier or not ...etc)
- Implement properly reset to default view in settings window for both the linear scale and log and for both axes,
basing off the base given by the user

Log view branch work:
- qpainter will do a graph scale and translation to match pixel units with graph units
- fill from range for seqs and functions

Export branch work:
- Make the actual exporting with the user given formats, the format left are image formats
- Implement tick spacing auto-update in export preview: easier in the new approach (simply update the base power)
- Unify the code for exportPreview and mainGraph into GraphDraw maybe.
- Change when the tick values disappear in the main graph on user move: draw bigger than the maingraph widget

- Fix bug with zooming in the main window, it doesn't work sometimes
- Enable adding additional pins in data tables to represent more than one curve per data table
- check if sequence draw with diffrent nmin work properly

Other work:
- update pictures in appdata/screenshots with new window layouts

Possible improvements:
- Change the curve saving from units in pixels to real units, scale the painter instead.
- Make a linestyle chooser widget based off a priori on QComboBox and images of line styles.
- Use it to offer the ability to change line styles for the grid and subgrid.
- Update the curve sampling method to an adaptive one: once the distance between points is bigger than the target in pixels, update.
