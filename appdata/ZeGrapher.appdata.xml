    <p>
      ZeGrapher is a plotting program for functions, sequences,
      parametric equations, and tabular data. It has been designed to
      be as easy to use as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZeGrapher supports importing and exporting of tabular data from
      and to CSV files and polynomial (regression) fits, plotting of
      tangents (the point can be selected interactively). Calculation
      and plotting of derivatives and integrals is also possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plots can be exported in various image formats and as PDF files.
