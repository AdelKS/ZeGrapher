ZeGrapher is a free, open source and easy to use software for plotting mathematical objects. It can plot functions, sequences, parametric equations and data on the plane.

### Features

ZeGrapher is in a deep rework stage, the features described here may still not be implemented.

- Visualize functions by giving their "natural" equations (e.g. `f(x) = 2+cos(x)`)
  - All the standard mathematical functions (`cos` `cosh` `exp` ...etc) can be used.
  - Any user defined function can be used.
  - Planned: compute derivatives and integrals.
- Visualize numerical sequences through specific equations
  - Defined by giving a list of expressions separated with `,` or `;`
  - The last expression is the "generic" expression that is used for any other index that the first values.
  - If more than one expression is provided, the first expressions are considered as the first values of the sequence
  - Example: Fibonacci sequence `u(n) = 0 ; 1 ; u(n-2) + u(n-2)`
    - First values: `0`, `1`
    - Generic expression: `u(n-2) + u(n-1)`
- Can define "global constants", i.e. a variable that has an explicit numeric value without depending on any other object
  - Example `pi = 3.14`
  - Can be used for parametric plots of functions, sequences and parametric equations.
- Can define "global variables", i.e. a function without input variables that can arbitrarily depend on other objects.
- Plotting of 2D data
  - Polynomial fitting (regression).
  - Data can be imported from/exported to a CSV file.
- Extensive tools for precise exporting
  - Image (`png`, `jpeg`, `tiff`, `gif`...) and scalable (`svg`, `pdf`) formats
  - Preview the graph exactly how it will look once exported
    - Set sizes in centimeter or in pixels
    - A global scaling factor is offered to change the DPI
    - Move the graph within the page
- Navigate on the graph :
  - Select a curve to display the coordinates of its points.
  - Zoom/unzoom on each axis separately, around the mouse (with the scroll wheel), or fit on a mouse drawn rectangle.
  - Move the graph.
- Customization/visualization
  - Linear and logarithmic scales
    - Can be set independently for `x` and `y` axes.
  - Can change the grid ticks to be multiples of a given variable/value
    - e.g. multiples of `Ï€`
  - Change colors: axes, background, functions...
  - Adjust the plotting precision.
    - Note that it will also affect rendering speed.
  - Show/hide the grid
  - Show/hide the subgrid.
    - user set number of subdivisions
  - Activate/deactivate curves\' smoothing.
  - Plot the graph on an orthonormal basis.

### Download
ZeGrapher is available in the official repositories of Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, FreeBSD. In the Archlinux (AUR). An [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) is otherwise available, along with Windows and Mac versions in Zegrapher's [Github releases page](https://github.com/AdelKS/ZeGrapher/releases) or at [zegrapher.com](https://zegrapher.com/).

### Compile from sources
To compile from sources, ZeGrapher needs the following tools and libraries:
- C++ compiler: [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) or [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [boost](https://www.boost.org/)
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io)
- [meson](mesonbuild.com)

To build
```shell
$ meson setup build
$ cd build
$ meson compile
$ cd ..
```
This creates the `ZeGrapher` executable in `build/src/ZeGrapher` that you can directly run.

###### Packaging

- Linux
  - `meson install` should now be fully XDG compliant. Issues and/PRs welcome if something is missing.
  - Use [deploy/linux-bundle-appimage.sh](./deploy/linux-bundle-appimage.sh) to create an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/).
- macOS
  - Use [deploy/macos-bundle-dmg.sh](deploy/macos-bundle-dmg.sh) to create an installer.
- Windows
  - _TODO_
