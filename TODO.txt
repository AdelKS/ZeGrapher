Currently working on:
    Make the actual exporting with the user given formats, the format left are image formats
    Update the curve sampling method to an adaptive one: once the distance between points is bigger than the target in pixels, update.
    Change the curve saving from units in pixels to real units, scale the painter instead.
    Implemet tick spacing auto-update in export preview. Unify the code for exportPreview and mainGraph into GraphDraw maybe.
    Change when the tick values disappear in the main graph on user move: draw bigger than the maingraph widget

- Fix bug with zooming in the main window, it doesn't work sometimes
- Improve the change of xStep and yStep after zooming. e.g. multiply by 2 till a power of 10 is reached
- add Latex support to write legends and x,y labels
- Enable adding additional pins in data tables to represent more than one curve per data table
- check if sequence draw with diffrent nmin work properly
