Currently working on:
    Make the actual exporting with the user given formats
    Implemet tick spacing auto-update in export preview. Unify the code for exportPreview and mainGraph into GraphDraw maybe.
    Change when the tick values disappear in the main graph on user move: draw bigger than the maingraph widget

- Fix bug with zooming in the main window, it doesn't work sometimes
- Improve the change of xStep and yStep after zooming. e.g. multiply by 2 till a power of 10 is reached
- add Latex support to write legends and x,y labels
- Enable adding additional pins in data tables to represent more than one curve per data table
- check if sequence draw with diffrent nmin work properly
